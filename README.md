TwitterPlaysPokemon
===================
Ok so, this is TwitterPlaysPokemon, it uses Pywinauto, win32api, win32con, and twython with Visual Studio. You're welcome to use it however you want, just don't sell it on, if anyopne is selling it please contact me. (This probably won't happen but you never know).

So the way it works is it will search its twitter for a reply, search a tweet for a command, then based on the command it will send it to Visual Boy Advance to do that move. It will then take a screenshot, save it into a folder, then tweet it out along with the tweet with the command.
So 
I probably won't work on this again however I'd like to get rid of anything that takes overthe mouse as it's inconsistent, I did change a mapping in Visual Studio so save is F1 (I think, it's been a while). If you need the VK codes they're here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/dd375731%28v=vs.85%29.aspx add them as you like.

Yeah, I would like to see this up and running, I did take the name @pokemoncommands on twitter if anyone wants it for themselves just send me a message.
